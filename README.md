# Singularity - Next.js 15 React Admin & Portfolio Theme

**Singularity** is a **professional, fully tested, quality-assured, robust, and commercial-grade** admin template and starter kit built with **Next.js 15** and **React 19**.

Originally developed to the highest industry standards for premium commercial use, this powerful theme is now being **given away completely free** under the permissive **MIT License**. You can use it for personal projects, client work, or even commercial products without any restrictions.

Designed for developers, agencies, and businesses, Singularity provides a rock-solid foundation for modern admin dashboards, e-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, creative portfolios, and AI-driven projects. It features modular architecture, reusable components, enterprise-level performance, and beautiful responsive design — everything you'd expect from a top-tier paid theme.
